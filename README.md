## Description

_\The assignment was to do 1.3 and to drive and compute a formula to find how many years  a billion seconds is. The second thing I did was 1.6 which was an interest rate formula and plugged values into formula. Lastly, I did 1.9 which was to debug and find the problems in a couple programs.\>_

## What I Learned from This

_\<I learned how to compute formulas and plug in values for variables. I also learned how to debug an equation that was written wrong.\>_
